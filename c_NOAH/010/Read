本文介绍了发源于美国并流行于欧洲各国的电话购物法，说明了电话购物法的发展情况以及受
大众欢迎的原因，同时也指出了这种购物法存在的问题，并提出了解决这些问题的途径。
答案简析 
1. A。上文讲到电话购物法在欧洲也开始起步，本句承接上文，对欧洲的情况作进一步介绍，因此，应选European。
2. D。电话购物法,应通过看电视选择物品，然后电话订购, 故应选TVs。
3. D。else为副词不用来修饰名词作定语。the other things意为“别的所有商品”不合文意，
选项many other things意为“别的许多商品”为正确选项。
4. B。such as中的as为介词，因此该词组用于列举时，后面常直接接名词或名词性短语。
而for example用于列举时与后面例子常用逗号隔开。因此B为正确选项。
5. D。分析句子，不难发现本句使用了“spend money in dong something”这一结构，
且主语the French为第三人称复数，故应用spend的原形。
6. B。该句子表示“在德国，每天电话购物法仅在一个频道播放一个小时，这种情况一直持续到去年”，
表示某状态一直持续到某个点时间，应用“until + 点时间”。
7. C。这里open表示“开放，开张，营业”，本句表示电影频道对电话购物实行了开放政策，可用来进行电话购物。
8. C。很明显，电话购物法为商人销售产品提供了一个极佳的渠道。因此本句表达了商人的愿望。
9. B。without为介词。后面应跟动词的-ing形式。根据文意，going out应为正确选项。
10. B。根据本句开头的But以及下文内容，这里提到的是对电话购物持反对态度的人。故选don’t。
11. A。一些人不喜欢电话购物法，称其为“垃圾”。故应选teleshopping。
12. C。人们担心的是电视上正在销售的产品的质量。A，B意思不对。for sale表示“待售”，为正确选项。
13. B。电话购物法令人们担心的是电视上展销的商品的质量，而不是商店里的商品，
也不是已经买到手的商品。故选on TV。
14. B。根据上文，欧洲人的购物观念与美国人有所不同。因此电话购物公司也得采取不同的措施。
固定结构be different form意为“不同于……”为正确答案。
15. B。根据上文，消费者关心的是质量。因此电话购物公司必须对质量倍加小心。故选择quality。

	  本文介绍了电脑的产生、发展以及在我们日常生活中广泛的使用，
	  针对一些人对将来电脑会控制人类的担忧，作者提出了自己的看法。
答案简析
1．	A。one of 后要用可数名词的复数形式，根据文章意思，可知答案是A。
2．	D。要表达第几个世纪，应该用“序数词＋century”，而根据常识，
计算机是二十世纪的产物，A项“二十一世纪”与实际不符合。
3．	B。固定搭配not only…but (also)… 意思是“不但……而且……”。所以答案是B。
4．	A。in many ways为一固定用法，表示“在许多方面”。
5．	D。根据文章大意，可知答案是D，表示“给人们带来财富和快乐”。
6．	C。因为Enid是名字，故用called。
7．	C。根据常识可知老式计算机庞大而笨重，故填large。
8．	D。该句句意为“自它诞生之日起，它的发展就非常迅速”，since在意思和时态上与主句呼应，为正确选项。
9．	C。动词短语go through表示“经历……”。
10．	D。
11．	A。用介词for+宾语表示“为人们做事”，故选A。
12．	C。know about表示“了解”，侧重于有关某人或某事的具体情况。
13．	A。learn后面接的是一个宾语从句，而且连接词在从句中做learn 的宾语，
所以只能用what，因为that在宾语从句中是纯连词，只能起连接作用，不能做句子成分。
14．	D。think of表示“想起；认为”；think about表示“考虑”；think out表示“想出”；根据文章含义，答案应是D。
15．	C。介词as表示“作为”，为正确选项。

2. A。根据他的想法，他“决定”要带十个仆人。这件事完全可以由他自己决定，所以没有必要“希望带……”或“努力带……”，故C、D不合题意。
3. C。carry在句中意为“携带、运送”；take 意为“带走”；bring意为“带来”。
本句意为“他们将运送要卖的东西和在路上要吃的食物”。下文的第10、11两题所在的句子也有提示。 
4. B。参照第3题。

2．C。这名工人是在推着一辆装有稻草的自行车，故选动词pushing。
3．D。这里表达的是到达边界之意arrive, come为不及物动词不可直接接 the frontier，故选reached。

8．B．根据文意，彼得心中一直怀着查获走私物品的希望，故选hoping。

本篇是一个寓言故事，说的是一只牧羊犬，因为天冷，就睡在牧羊人给羊吃的干草上。
结果，羊吃不着草，感到非常生气，他们认为狗太自私，自己又不能吃草，还不让能吃草的吃。
答案简析
1.	B。从下文可知天是在下雪。
2.	A。上文说天在下着大雪，所以地上应该被覆盖着“厚厚的”雪。
3.	C。可能有同学会选go to the hill，但比较climb up the hill，后者更符合常理。
意为“在这种天气下爬上山是很危险的。”
4.	B。根据常理，羊在那儿也很难找到草。
5.	D。天冷，牧羊人就想呆在温暖的房间里。英语里一般不用hot room。
6.	C。后面是一个完整的句子，所以不可以用in order to或so as to。so that意为“以便”，后面得跟一个完整的句子。
7.	A。全句意为“牧羊人把干草放在围栏里以便羊在饿的时候能吃”。
8.	B。躺在软草上，用soft最恰当。
9.	C。羊都很害怕狗。“三者以上的都”只有用all。
10.	A。没有一只羊能接近它。

	文章以在陌生的城市找名胜为例，说明了解决数学最重要的是先找出一条通往答案的路径。
答案简析
1．C。下文表明：你要去的是一个一点儿都不熟悉的城市，说明以前没有去过
。故选have never visited。
2．D。show意为“带领某人参观某地”或“向某人展示某物”；tell sb. about sth.
 意为“告诉某人关于……的情况。根据下文可知tell为正确选项。
3．A。文章表明：听了别人的介绍后，你对城市的名胜开始有了一些初步的印象。
故选begin。
4．B。根据文意，你对名胜的概况只是听说而已，对名胜的具体位置及如何找到所指的名胜不太清楚。
故选clear。
5．C。指代上文出现的interesting places应用them。
6．A。根据句意，前半句是后半句的条件状语从句，应用if引导。
7．D。show sb. sth.意为“把……给某人看”，合符文意，为正确选项。
8．B。根据地图上的位置，你会毫不费力地找到想去的地方。故选no。

Many animals use some kinds of “language”. They use signals(信号) and the signals
 have meanings. For example, __1   a bee has found some food, it goes   2   its home.

本文主要想告诉读者，学英语是一个长期而艰苦的劳动，没有任何捷径可走。
无论你用什么方法学习――用书、机器或在学校，不多实践就无法达到预期的目的。
答案简析
1.	B。这里的or是“否则”的意思。
2.	C。根据作者的观点，这种事绝对不可能发生。impossible是一个形容词，
不符语法，can’t后不可能跟happens，often意思与作者的意图相反。
3.	D。唯一容易学的语言是母语。这里需要一个形容词充当后置定语。
4.	A。用来修饰不可数名词，只有用how much，全句意为“母语好学，
还需要那么多的练习。”何况外语呢？。
5.	B。动词不定式充当目的状语。意为“学习外语来研究文学”。
6.	C。说某种语言用speak，speak English，speak Chinese。
7.	D。用it代指上文所说的a foreign language。
8.	B。这里的with是“用”的意思。
9.	A。作者在这里提出一种假设。如果他们一星期只有一两次使用外语。
10.	C。固定短语，意为“做某事花费某人多长时间”。
11.	B。后面省略了than 6 hours。意为6个小时或更多的时间。
12.	D。it 代指上文所指的foreign language，故用被动被态。
13.	C。许多人不可能做到这一点。这里不可以用not possible，
因为它的主语不可以用人。
14.	D。机器和书对于学习英语来说是很有帮助的。
15. B。whether …or…固定短语。

 liked   5   school. He would rub(摩擦) the end of the thermometer (温度计)
 until it went   6   to 39℃. Then he’d put it in his mouth and his mother 
 would think he was   7   ill.
This morning I tried doing that but it   8   went above 35℃ and I rubbed 
it for ten   9  . So I held the thermometer   10   the light on my desk
 and it went up to 40℃. I thought I’d put it in my mouth and walk downstairs 
 like that.   11   my mother would take it out and she would be   12   when 
 she saw that I was rather ill.
The only trouble was I didn’t know the thermometer would be so   13  , As 
soon as I put it into my mouth I burnt my tongue(舌头)! I spit (吐) the 
thermometer out. It fell   14   the floor but it   15  .

这是一篇小幽默。一个男孩为了装病，用尽了各种办法想告诉妈妈自己的体温很高，结果差点儿烫伤了自己。

2．B。这里应选择情态动词should, 表示在该穿毛衣的时候他不穿, 其实他就是想让自己冻出病来。
3．B。跟上两题同解。
4．D。so far常与动词的现在完成时连用，表示“到目前为止”。
5．A。leave school表示“辍学、毕业离校”的动作，be away from school则表示“不上学、逃学”的状态。
6．C。up表示“温度上升”。
7．A。妈妈会认为他真的病了，故选副词really。
8．C。其他选项在语法上均错。
